# ACM-WH 2018
## Problem:
Many patients do not have access to medications and on the other hand drugs often expire at healthcare provider facilities, resulting in wasted medication. Our inspiration stems from a desire to combat this problem at a feasible level.

## Solution we offer:
Our project aims to redistribute unopened and near expiry medications at lower prices to patients that belong to lower socio economic background

## Tech Stack :
* MongoDB for Data Persistence
* NodeJS for web framework
* HTML for structuring data
* CSS and JS for client side UI changes
* Express, node framework
* Python for Image recognition

## Features :
A pharmacist with near expiry medicines can list them on our web application. Anybody who requires a medicine can look it up on our web app and make a selection after which he will be required to upload the prescription which will be automatically authenticated.
By bridging the gap between pharmacist with surplus near expiry medicines and a patient in need of them this app will have a 3 fold impact-
- Reducing/eliminating wastage of medicines which get expired and thus revenue
- Providing low cost medicines to someone who needs them
- Reducing environmental degradation which would have occurred due to disposal of expired drugs
